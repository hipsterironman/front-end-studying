# What does a doctype do?

This is somewhat of a historical artifact. It tells the browser to render the following document to standards rather than in "quirks mode," which emulates nonstandard behavior in Netscape Navigator 4 and Internet Explorer 5. There's little reason to use anything other than `<!DOCTYPE html>` today.
